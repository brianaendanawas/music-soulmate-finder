# Music Soulmate Finder — Week 5 Vision

## What the app is now
- AWS-based backend (Lambda + API Gateway + DynamoDB)
- Stores music taste profiles
- Returns ranked matches based on shared artists
- Uses test users (no auth, no Spotify)

## What I want it to become
- A social app for people with similar music taste
- Users feel like real people, not IDs
- Focus on connection, not just data

## Future social features
- View another user’s profile
- See shared artists clearly
- Follow / connect with users
- (Later) messaging or interaction

## Why Spotify is paused for now
- Spotify OAuth adds a lot of complexity
- Current focus is:
  - clear backend logic
  - explainable matching
  - stable cloud architecture
- Spotify will return later as a feature, not the foundation
